        Physics Explanation:
            The coefficient of restitution (COR or e) is like a "bounciness" factor for collisions.
            It tells us how much energy is kept after two objects hit each other. A COR of 1
            means the collision is very bouncy (no energy lost), while 0 means all energy is lost
            during the collisions.

            In this pool game, I use the COR for calculating the impulse during
            a collision. Impulse is the change in momentum resulting from the collision,
            and it is applied to both balls to adjust their loss in velocities.
            For pool balls, the COR is around 0.96.

        Physics Explanation:
            The ball's movement is affected by friction, which slows it down over time.
            Friction is a force that opposes the motion of the ball (F = Âµmg).

            In this simulation, I use frictional force to adjust the ball's velocity.
            If the speed drops below a certain level, the ball is considered to have stopped.
            This is because it would took a while to decelerate when it come to a certain point.
